R_1JVpa7tFAoZU0Ms,A,1,"I worry about them influencing results, especially with these chatbots that act like humans."
R_1NfF685yu2hvkDO,A,1,"Bots are clearly a big problem for social psychology research but less of an issue for developmental work, which tends to be moderated."
R_2vche1U9i8IKvNu,A,1,"This is something that I was not familiar with before this survey, but now brought to my attention I find to be incredibly interesting and impactful. Bots have the ability to skew data by impersonating participants."

R_1nSHBJPAFOVhx56,A,1,"I'm not sure how common they are. I suspect I ran into a handful at most in my graduate work but in general I think they're overhyped. And there are plenty of mechanisms to filter out bots, such as the CAPTCHA you used at the start of this survey."

R_A4K9DD3sCsGij0B,A,1,Frustrating to know how to detect. Makes me question my study results at times which is frustrating since I know I’ve designed it well.
R_30bCUomrs8uUAg2,A,1,"I think it is unlikely that bots complete surveys. Instead, I think inattentive humans complete surveys quickly."
R_2y3DwZa5QCUKHNr,A,1,It would sharply skew the data results
R_vekEwtK20Zj6JyN,A,1,NA
R_1NXgo3PdST2DXeF,A,1,"I think bots can harm psychological research in a variety of ways. Data privded by bots could change results which could then lead to findings resulting in erronous conclusions. On a smaller note, bots impact researchers by adding mental work when thinking about how to adress bots in online surveys and can have financial costs to the researchers where they have to collect additional participants."

R_3dVNdFboMSkD9GI,A,1,"Bot complicate findings, making conclusion to be difficult,  which render the effort meaningless."
R_oYoGyAAqqUMJ95f,A,1,It never occurred to me until I saw the tweet for this study. Seems like a scary problem because it could so easily skew results. But it's a problem that I would expect to be easily avoided with techniques like open-ended questions and captchas. It would be great to see studies specify how they screened for bots in their methods sections.
