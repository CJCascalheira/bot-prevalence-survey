These measures are peer-reviewed standard procedures (Kennedy et al., 2020; Winter et al., 2019) and/or recommended by Qualtrics Support. We would like to incorporate the following: Embedded Code: Each participant will be assigned a random embedded code when they enter the survey. Participants will be shown their unique code at the END of the survey and instructed to email the code to the PI, for it will be necessary to receive compensation. The participant must email the correct, valid code to receive payment. Participants will be clearly warned that they must enter a valid survey generated code to receive compensation. No identifiable data (other than for security questions, see below) will be requested in the research survey. Only PIs will have access to the codebook that lists valid codes that could be linked to emails/names. However, we will NOT identify or re-identify the data collected in the research survey. This method is only necessary for ensuring that real participants are compensated and bots/server farms are intercepted.   IP address cross-check: Because several real participants and ""fake participants""/bots completed the survey, we have a block that compares participants' IP address to the list of IP addresses collected from the compensation survey. In conjunction with the ballot box stuffing prevention setting, this will prevent previous participants from accessing the survey again. IP Hub or a similar IP location checking website will be used to cross-check IP addresses.  3. 4. 5. 6. VPS/VPN check: A warning at the beginning of the survey will tell participants that the checker will make sure they are not using a VPS, VPN, or proxy to hide their country. It will also tell participants to turn off blocking applications, VPSs, VPNs, and/or proxies- failure to do so may prevent completion of the survey.  reCAPTCHA: This test will ensure no robots can enter the survey. Failing this test will result in immediate closure of the survey. Participants will be warned and told to complete the reCAPTCHA test before continuing to the information sheet.  Embedded Data (ED) checks: After the information sheet, participants will complete an ED block. Participants will also complete another ED block at the end of the survey. The first ED block will ask participants to select from a drop down list their 1) birth month, 2) birth year, 3) current city of residence, 4) current state of residence, and 5) a question asking respondents to briefly describe what their task is in the study. The last ED block will ask participants to 1) type in a text box their age 2) select their city and state from a multiple choice list containing pre-selected small town names (both responses will be cross-checked with their answers in the first ED block), and 3) a question that provides a simple instruction (e.g., Describe your favorite way to spend 1 hour on a sunny day. Please write 1 sentence.) to prove human-ness. This identifying information will only be used for security purposes and NOT to identify participants.  Referral Website: One last method of security is to add reddit.com and fetlife.com as referral URLs. That is, individuals who click the link from those websites will be able to access the survey. But if clicked on through Facebook somehow, where the survey link is not posted, the individual will not be able to access the survey",NA,"I did the best that I could and if I had any suspicions, I validated those and stuck to my gut.

Also, talking to someone more experienced that me really made a difference in my ability to integrate these security measures.",The steps I used were very successful in detecting bots and server farms! I recommend them to everyone.

We had four of them. The odds of the bots beating all four went down quite a bit, and then we didn't have to pay them because they were removed before participation. We'd then usually catch the rest of them at a later point with other techniques.","Take this seriously, it's a huge problem on MTurk. Use more exclusions and include a lot of checks -- bots can easily beat any one question, but you can beat them with a ton of them. Also, if your data don't look right, trust your nose -- if they look wrong, it's probably because they are.","I take a big-picture view of it. All data has error. That's a given. But if I replicate findings over multiple studies, then the odds that I'm getting something spurious goes down. I generally try to ensure that the data are clean enough that that can happen. On the flip side, I sometimes test data by applying a hyper-standard that excludes more than less (thus probably excluding real participants as well), just to verify that there isn't anything bad happening. If the methods yield different results (they haven't so far), then that's a problem.","I think it's absurd that we're dealing with this at this end at all. I think MTurk and other platforms should have more careful exclusion technology, or provide more help for it. I read all about it and then, after nothing helped, I basically invented my own methods which seemed to work. That's kind of pathetic, that the people care so little about researchers as that.","I haven't collected an MTurk study in about a year, so it's possible they've gotten better since then. I doubt it, though. Maybe other services have better safeguards in place, too. My estimates throughout are complicated because we've run so many studies where we've progressively upped our bot-detection mechanisms. The last studies we ran, we only get a handful through the initial screening and then we take them out on the back end."

I would recommend open ended questions to catch for bots. Do not automatically grant compensation, and include attention checks that are easy for humans to respond to but not bots per se","I coded my data into real (verified), probably real, suspicious and bots. Through additional recruitment I was able to make sure the number of verifiably real participants was the largest number. I was also able to do this as this was a second round data collection and compensation was not a part of the second round. If I was suspicious of data I did not include it knowing that I might have let real data go",Maybe put compensation in the flier but not in the text near the survey link. Include attention checks.,Great study! Keep up the good work and the research from this will help a lot of researchers in the future. I think also including a section about how to handle the IRB as it relates to compensating or not compensating bots might help. Luckily many of the bots did not complete the % of the survey they would have needed to to obtain compensation (as stated in my IRB) but with out that protection it could have been a messy situation

I feel very conflicted about this since most of my research asks marginalized respondents to disclose sensitive information. I also recommend utilizing all of the bot detection features available in survey software--I begged our university to add this to our Qualtrics subscription. I also recommend avoiding social media posts unless those posts are in relatively small groups. I've started recruiting more in college classrooms, which is a practice I think we should all move away from, but one where we're less likely to see bots. Finally, screen all responses closely--run all possible bot checks before doing any data analysis and before ending recruitment.","This has often come down to the sample size--what do we need and how conservative can I afford to be in removing what may be human data. Particularly for dissertation student projects, they are often on a time and financial budget that may make me a little less conservative; for my own work, I'm likely to be more conservative (because I have tenure and I'm less dependent on churning out publications, particularly in a teaching focused position).","I would love more information about best practices in removing bots. I feel like they started showing up all of a sudden and I've been scrambling to pull together a set of best practices, particularly as I support dissertation students.",Thank you for doing this survey!
